As before, we update based on the amount by which our estimate differs from the observation. However, we also shrink the size of towards zero. That is why the method is sometimes called “weight decay”: given the penalty term alone, our optimization algorithm decays the weight at each step of training.Spiral learning is a teaching method based on the premise that a student learns more about a subject each time the topic is reviewed or encountered. The idea is that each time a student encounters the topic, the student expands their knowledge or improves their skill level. Also see Mastery Learning.by Adrian Rosebrock on July 29, 2019. In this tutorial, you will learn how to use Cyclical Learning Rates (CLR) and Keras to train your own neural networks. Using Cyclical Learning Rates you can dramatically reduce the number of experiments required to tune and find an optimal learning rate for your model.The 1cycle policy gives very fast results when training complex models. It follows the Cyclical Learning Rate (CLR) to obtain faster training time with regularization effect but with a slight modification. Picking the right learning rate at different iterations helps model to converge quicklyWhat is Cyclical Learning Rate? A technique to set and change and tweak LR during training. This methodology aims to train neural network with a LR that changes in a cyclical way for each batch, instead of a non-cyclic LR that is either constant or changes on every epoch.
